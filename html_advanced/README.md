## Header

In the header section, we've created an HTML skeleton with the necessary elements. Inside the header, you'll find a link element with an image and a block of three link elements. This sets the foundation for our webpage.


## Banner

The banner section is designed to capture attention and engage users. Under the header, a main element houses a section with two blocks. The first block contains a heading, text, and a button. The second block consists of four sub-blocks, each containing an image, heading, and text.



## Quote

Following the banner, there's a quote section within the main element. This section includes an image, a block with a quote, author information, and additional text.



## Videos

The videos section presents a list of videos. Within a new section, you'll find a heading and a block containing four video blocks. Each video block comprises an image, heading, text, author block (image, heading), and a rating block.



## Membership

Similar to the videos list, the membership section follows. This section includes an heading and a block with four item blocks. Each item block consists of an image, heading, text, and a button.


## FAQ

The FAQ section concludes our webpage. This section contains two row blocks, each with two item blocks. Each item block includes a heading and text.


## Footer

Finally, the footer section is positioned after the last section. It includes a global block for centering footer content, an image, a row block with images and a text block.



Stay tuned for the next update where CSS will be applied to enhance the visual appeal of our webpage!
